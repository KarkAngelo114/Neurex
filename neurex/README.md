# NeurexJS

Neurex is a JavaScript-based neural network library for Node.js, designed to be fully trainable and easy to integrate into your applications.

## How to get started

1. Ensure you have NodeJS installed on your machine. If you haven't installed it yet, download it here: https://nodejs.org/en/download
2. Create a new folder and navigate to your created folder in your terminal.
3. Once you're inside your project directory, install Neurex using this command:

```bash

npm install neurex

```
4. After successful installation, you can now train ANN models and do predictions in your backend applications.
